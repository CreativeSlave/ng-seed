# Angular 8+ Seed Project
 > An Angular 8+ Business Starter, Open Source, MIT, (and Open Self-Service System) 
This is intended to be a Full-Stack System that can be configured and designed by selecting (Lazy-Loaded) Module features, with limitless extensibility. Configuring Application 'Features' is to be as easy as either setting up a static configuration file, or setting  up a datasource, identify the Module to be included inthe app. 

 > A Module can be included in the source code, or served by a hosted Module Service (non-proprietary service)

### Intent and Purpose
I will be creating an MIT-licensed, Angular 8+ See project based on best practives, documentation, schematices, administration for Admins, Customers, and a company site, and a blog. It is intended to use GitHub as the core CMS (Content Management System) as it simplifies administration.

### All Module-Based/Plug-in/Play Optional Interface   
Dynamically load modules as needed, database to configure application features, to automatically add as needed.
