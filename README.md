# Angular 8+ Seed Project
 > An Angular 8+ Business Starter, Open Source, MIT, (and Open Self-Service System)   
This is intended to be a Full-Stack System that can be configured and designed by a developer by selecting (Lazy-Loaded) Module features, with limitless extensibility. Configuring Application 'Features' is to be as easy as either setting up a static configuration file, or setting  up a datasource, identify the Module to be included inthe app. It is intended that any developer can resell an application, but not rights to code.    
  
 > A Module can be included in the source code, or served by a hosted Module Service (non-proprietary service)

### Intent and Purpose
I will be creating an MIT-licensed, Angular 8+ See project based on best practives, documentation, schematices, administration for Admins, Customers, and a company site, and a blog. It is intended to use GitHub as the core CMS (Content Management System) as it simplifies administration. 

## So, Why do this?
NO MORE LICENSES OR PAYMENTS FOR AN OPEN SOURCE ANGULAR PROJECT!   
Plus, a configurable methodology to plugin features even during run-time. Once a developer forks and creates his/her own project, that project then belongs to that developer.

### All Module-Based/Plug-in/Play Optional Interface   
Dynamically load modules as needed, database to configure application features, to automatically add as needed. 


### Finally 
Absolutely NO need to provide credits to anyone, (unless it is a third party plugin).   

After I set up the base project I will open this up to all who wish to contribute to a truely free, credit-free(*), admin dashboard, themable website .. the entire small-to-large scale application.    

 > (*)Credit Free: Means that credits to the developments is not required. This give the developer the ability to build a product on the fly without worry of legal implications.
